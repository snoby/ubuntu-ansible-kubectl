# ubuntu-ansible-kubectl
Docker container that runs kubectl along with ansible

## Why
I created this image to run ansible playbooks for me that also needed the Kubernetes kubectl utility version 1.6.1.  As the future comes I'm sure I will upgrade this to a later version, howver for now that is the version that is used.  See the Dockerfile for relavant changes.
